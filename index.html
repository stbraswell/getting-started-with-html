<B>1) <em>The Internet</em></B>
<p> The Internet is a collection of computers that talk to each other. The web is a collection of
  HTML docs.  When a user clicks on a link, that link is essentially an address to an HTML file on a server.
  The browser translates that HTML file into a webpage that the user sees.  HTTP is the main protocol of the web.  HTML stands for Hypetext Markup Language.
</p>

<b>2) <em>Tags</em></b>
<p>Tags are instructions to the computer and are not seen outside of the code <em> (e.g. on the webpage).</em>  Elements are the complete tag, so from opening to closing.  These are also the "markup". Some tags need to be closed, 
if these types of tags are not closed, then the tag will apply to all text following the opening of the tag.  Other tags
do not need to be closed, these are called "Void Tags".  Tags can also have attributes.  These attributes give more dimension to a tag, such as linking a webpage to text.
</p>
<b>3) <em>Whitespace in HTML</em></b>
<p>Whitespace in HTML doesn't translate 1:1 on the webpage.  Spaces seem to be 1:1, but multiple spaces or carrige returns do not.  For example,
  this is what 10 spaces looks like "          ". 
</p>
<b>4) <em>Inline and Block</em></b>
<p>There are inline and block elements.  Block elements seem to protect their contents by fencing them, like the paragraph element.</p>

<b>5) <em>Other Thoughts:</em></b>
<p>a. Hey look, I'm already writing in HTML!<br>
  b. Computers take code literally and want it to be in an exact format.  One sintax mistake and it's not going to do what you thought you told it to do.<br>
  c. You can't know everything about coding or a particular language; that's why we have <a href="www.google.com"> this </a>
